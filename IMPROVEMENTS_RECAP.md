# Enhanced CSV Data Quality Checker - Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
Original checker missed critical data quality issues like invalid dates (not_a_date), invalid integers (invalid_age), and mixed data types because it only validated pandas dtypes, not actual cell content.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced Content Validation
- Added cell-by-cell inspection for data type validation
- New validation functions for integers, floats, dates, and booleans
- Detects invalid values within columns regardless of pandas dtype

### 2. New Data Consistency Check
- Always-on check for missing values, mixed types, and suspicious patterns
- Reports missing value counts and percentages per column
- Identifies columns with both numeric and text values mixed together

### 3. Improved Detection Capabilities
- Invalid dates: now catches non-date strings in date columns
- Invalid integers: detects text values in numeric columns
- Mixed data types: flags columns with inconsistent value types
- Better error reporting with row indices and specific violations

### 4. Enhanced UI Display
- Content Issues section showing invalid values with row numbers
- Consistency Issues section with detailed breakdowns
- Better formatted violation tables for easier review

## Issues Now Detected
Your problematic CSV data will now properly identify:
- visit_date column: invalid entries like not_a_date and wrong_date
- age column: non-numeric values like invalid_age and NaN entries
- blood_pressure column: text values like abc in numeric context
- Mixed data types across all columns with detailed reporting

## Usage Instructions
1. Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run streamlit app with streamlit run app.py
3. Upload your CSV file with data quality issues
4. Configure schema in sidebar for enhanced validation
5. Review comprehensive results with specific issue locations

## Technical Implementation
- Enhanced check_data_types function with content validation
- New check_data_consistency function for baseline quality assessment
- Updated pipeline to include consistency check by default
- Improved UI components for displaying new issue types

The enhanced checker now provides comprehensive data quality insights and catches all previously missed validation issues.
